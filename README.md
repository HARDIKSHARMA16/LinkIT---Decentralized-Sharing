# ðŸ’¾ Decentralized File Storage System

A browser-based platform designed for securely uploading and managing files using blockchain technology.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This Decentralized File Storage System offers a blockchain-integrated web interface where users can store files securely and control access permissions. By utilizing wallet-based identity, users can view their personal files and grant or revoke access to others through an allowlist mechanism. The platform emphasizes privacy, ownership, and full control over shared data.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Immutable File Uploads**  
  Files are uploaded and stored on the blockchain, providing integrity and resistance to tampering.

- **Wallet-Based Access**  
  Files can be accessed directly through the browser by connecting a compatible crypto wallet.

- **Selective Sharing**  
  Share specific files by adding target wallet addresses to the allowlist.

- **Manage Access Rights**  
  Easily control who can or cannot view your data by updating the allowlist.

- **Revoke Access Anytime**  
  Enhance data security by disallowing addresses with a single click.
